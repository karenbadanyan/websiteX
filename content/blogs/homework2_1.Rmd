# Data Visualisation - Exploration

Now that you've demonstrated your software is setup, and you have the basics of data manipulation, the goal of this assignment is to practice transforming, visualising, and exploring data.

# Mass shootings in the US

In July 2012, in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/) published a report on mass shootings in the United States since 1982. Importantly, they provided the underlying data set as [an open-source database](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) for anyone interested in studying and understanding this criminal behavior.

## Obtain the data

```{r}
#| echo: false

file_path <- "/Users/karenbadanyan/Desktop/mydsb23/mass_shootings.csv"
mass_shootings <- read_csv(here::here("mass_shootings.csv"))

## Explore the data

### Specific questions

-   Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of mass shootings per year.

```{r}
# number of mass shootings per year
mass_shootings %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

```

-   Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of mass shooters associated with each race category. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest and each bar should show its number.

```{r}
# number of mass shooters associated with each race category
mass_shootings %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  na.omit(count) %>%
  mutate(race = fct_reorder(race,count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=count,y=race))+geom_col()+geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = -0.5, color = "red", size = 4) + 
  xlab("Number of Mass Shooters") +
  ylab("Race") +
  ggtitle("Dominance of White Race in the Number of Mass Shooters")
```

-   Generate a boxplot visualizing the number of total victims, by type of location.

```{r}
# all categories
mass_shootings %>%
  mutate(location_type = fct_reorder(location_type,total_victims)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=location_type,y=total_victims))+geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Location") +
  ylab("Number of Victims") +
  ggtitle("Number of Victims per Location Type")

# without "other" location_type
mass_shootings %>%
  filter(location_type != "Other") %>%
  mutate(location_type = fct_reorder(location_type, total_victims)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Location") +
  ylab("Number of Victims") +
  ggtitle("Number of Victims per Location Type")
```


-   Redraw the same plot, but remove the Las Vegas Strip massacre from the dataset.

```{r}
# without the Las Vegas Strip massacre
mass_shootings %>%
  filter(case != "Las Vegas Strip massacre") %>%
  mutate(location_type = fct_reorder(location_type, total_victims)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Location") +
  ylab("Number of Victims") +
  ggtitle("Number of Victims per Location Type")
```

### More open-ended questions

Address the following questions. Generate appropriate figures/tables to support your conclusions.

-   How many white males with prior signs of mental illness initiated a mass shooting after 2000?

```{r}
# filter white males with prior signs of mental illness after Year 2000
mass_shootings %>%
  filter(male & race == "White" & prior_mental_illness == "Yes" & year >  2000) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```

-   Which month of the year has the most mass shootings? Generate a bar chart sorted in chronological (natural) order (Jan-Feb-Mar- etc) to provide evidence of your answer.

```{r}
# assign month order
month_order <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul",
                 "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")

# group by month for count and order chronologically
mass_shootings %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month_order)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = count)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Number of Victims") +
  ggtitle("Number of Victims per Month")
  
```

-   How does the distribution of mass shooting fatalities differ between White and Black shooters? What about White and Latino shooters?

```{r}
# distribution of mass shooting fatalities for White, Black and Latino
mass_shootings %>%
  filter(race == "White" | race == "Black" | race == "Latino") %>%
  group_by(race, year) %>%
  summarise (fatalities = sum(fatalities)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=fatalities))+geom_line(aes(colour = race)) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Fatalities") +
  ggtitle("White Fatalities above the others throughout the Years")

```

### Very open-ended

-   Are mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness different from mass shootings with no signs of mental illness in the shooter?

```{r}
mass_shootings %>%
  filter(prior_mental_illness == "Yes" | prior_mental_illness == "No") %>%
  group_by(prior_mental_illness, year) %>%
  summarise (count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=count))+geom_col(aes(colour = prior_mental_illness)) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Shooters") +
  ggtitle("People with Mental Ilness have more tendency to Mass Shootings")
```

-   Assess the relationship between mental illness and total victims, mental illness and location type, and the intersection of all three variables.

```{r}
library (GGally)

mass_shootings %>%
 select(prior_mental_illness, location_type, total_victims) %>%
 drop_na(prior_mental_illness) %>%
 ggpairs()

```
