# The Bechdel Test

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/

The [Bechdel test](https://bechdeltest.com) is a way to assess how women are depicted in Hollywood movies.  In order for a movie to pass the test:

1. It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something besides a man

There is a nice article and analysis you can find here https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/
We have a sample of 1394 movies and we want to fit a model to predict whether a film passes the test or not.

```{r read_data}

bechdel <- read_csv(here::here("data", "bechdel.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(test = factor(test)) 
glimpse(bechdel)

```
How many films fail/pass the test, both as a number and as a %?

```{r}
bechdel %>%
  mutate(total_count = n()) %>%
  group_by(test) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), percent = count/total_count) %>%
  distinct (test,count, percent)
```


## Movie scores
```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdel, aes(
  x = metascore,
  y = imdb_rating,
  colour = test
)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3, size = 3) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("tomato", "olivedrab")) +
  labs(
    x = "Metacritic score",
    y = "IMDB rating",
    colour = "Bechdel test"
  ) +
 theme_light()
```


# Split the data
```{r}
# **Split the data**

set.seed(123)

data_split <- initial_split(bechdel, # updated data
                           prop = 0.8, 
                           strata = test)

bechdel_train <- training(data_split) 
bechdel_test <- testing(data_split)
```

Check the counts and % (proportions) of the `test` variable in each set.
```{r}
bechdel_train %>%
  mutate(total_count = n()) %>%
  group_by(test) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), percent = count/total_count) %>%
  distinct (test,count, percent)

bechdel_test %>%
  mutate(total_count = n()) %>%
  group_by(test) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), percent = count/total_count) %>%
  distinct (test,count, percent)
```

## Feature exploration

## Any outliers? 

```{r}

bechdel %>% 
  select(test, budget_2013, domgross_2013, intgross_2013, imdb_rating, metascore) %>% 

    pivot_longer(cols = 2:6,
               names_to = "feature",
               values_to = "value") %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=test, y = value, fill = test)+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~feature, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(x=NULL,y = NULL)

# There are obvious outliers in intgross_2013 since some of them are above 200 when the majority is less than 50.
# There are also couple of points in domgross_2013 but the amplitude is not that much
```

## Scatterplot - Correlation Matrix

Write a paragraph discussing the output of the following 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
bechdel %>% 
  select(test, budget_2013, domgross_2013, intgross_2013, imdb_rating, metascore)%>% 
  ggpairs(aes(colour=test), alpha=0.2)+
  theme_bw()

# Both pass and fail have normal distribution for "metascore". Regarding "imdb_rating" it is a little bit left skewed. In contrast, "bydget_2013", "domgross_2013" and "intgross_2013" are highly right-skewed. There are obvious outliers in intgross_2013 since some of them are above 200 when the majority is less than 50. The highest correlation is between "domgross_2013" and "intgross_2013" for both fail and pass. "domgross_2013" and "intgross_2013" are also correlated with "budget_2013". "metascore" is correlated with "imdb_rating". 
```


## Categorical variables

Write a paragraph discussing the output of the following 
```{r}
genre_test <- bechdel %>% 
  group_by(genre, test) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
  
genre_test
genre_test %>%
  rename(count = n) %>%
  mutate(genre = fct_reorder(genre, count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = genre, fill = test)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(prop,2)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))

# Majority of films are "Action", "Comedy" and "Drama" (more than 100 films). What is evident from the first glance is that around 71% of action films fail. The other genres are splt more or less equally. 

rated_test <- bechdel %>% 
  group_by(rated, test) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))

rated_test
rated_test %>%
  rename(count = n) %>%
  mutate(rated = fct_reorder(rated, count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = rated, fill = test)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(prop,2)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))

# Vast majority of films are rated either "PG", "PG-13" or "R". In all 3 categories films fail the test slightly more than half of the times.
```

# Train first models. `test ~ metascore + imdb_rating`

```{r}
lr_mod <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine(engine = "glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

lr_mod


tree_mod <- decision_tree() %>% 
  set_engine(engine = "C5.0") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

tree_mod 
```

```{r}


lr_fit <- lr_mod %>% # parsnip model
  fit(test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, # a formula
    data = bechdel_train # dataframe
  )

tree_fit <- tree_mod %>% # parsnip model
  fit(test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, # a formula
    data = bechdel_train # dataframe
  )
```

## Logistic regression

```{r}
lr_fit %>%
  broom::tidy()

lr_preds <- lr_fit %>%
  augment(new_data = bechdel_train) %>%
  mutate(.pred_match = if_else(test == .pred_class, 1, 0))
lr_preds
```

### Confusion matrix

```{r}
lr_preds %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = test, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")


```


## Decision Tree
```{r}
tree_preds <- tree_fit %>%
  augment(new_data = bechdel) %>%
  mutate(.pred_match = if_else(test == .pred_class, 1, 0)) 


```

```{r}
tree_preds %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = test, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

## Draw the decision tree

```{r}
draw_tree <- 
    rpart::rpart(
        test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
        data = bechdel_train, 
        control = rpart::rpart.control(maxdepth = 5, cp = 0, minsplit = 10)
    ) %>% 
    partykit::as.party()
plot(draw_tree)

```

# Cross Validation

Run the code below. What does it return?

```{r}
set.seed(123)
bechdel_folds <- vfold_cv(data = bechdel_train, 
                          v = 10, 
                          strata = test)
bechdel_folds
```

## `fit_resamples()`

Trains and tests a resampled model.

```{r}
lr_fit <- lr_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
    resamples = bechdel_folds
  )


tree_fit <- tree_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
    resamples = bechdel_folds
  )
```


## `collect_metrics()`

Unnest the metrics column from a tidymodels `fit_resamples()`
```{r}

collect_metrics(lr_fit)
collect_metrics(tree_fit)


```


```{r}
tree_preds <- tree_mod %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, 
    resamples = bechdel_folds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE) 
  )

# What does the data for ROC look like?
tree_preds %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = test, .pred_Pass)  

# Draw the ROC
tree_preds %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = test, .pred_Pass) %>% 
  autoplot()

```


# Build a better training set with `recipes`

## Preprocessing options

- Encode categorical predictors
- Center and scale variables
- Handle class imbalance
- Impute missing data
- Perform dimensionality reduction 
- ... ...

## To build a recipe

1. Start the `recipe()`
1. Define the variables involved
1. Describe **prep**rocessing [step-by-step]

## Collapse Some Categorical Levels

Do we have any `genre` with few observations?  Assign genres that have less than 3% to a new category 'Other'


```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
bechdel %>% 
  count(genre) %>% 
  mutate(genre = fct_reorder(genre, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genre, 
             y = n)) +
  geom_col(alpha = .8) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = (nrow(bechdel_train)*.03), lty = 3)+
  theme_light()
```


```{r}
movie_rec <-
  recipe(test ~ .,
         data = bechdel_train) %>%
  
  # Genres with less than 5% will be in a catewgory 'Other'
    step_other(genre, threshold = .03) 
```
  

## Before recipe

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
bechdel_train %>% 
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)
```


## After recipe

```{r}
movie_rec %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  bake(new_data = bechdel_train) %>% 
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)
```

## `step_dummy()`

Converts nominal data into numeric dummy variables

```{r}
#| results = "hide"
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 

movie_rec 
```

## Let's think about the modelling 

What if there were no films with `rated` NC-17 in the training data?

-  Will the model have a coefficient for `rated` NC-17?
-  What will happen if the test data includes a film with `rated` NC-17?

## `step_novel()`

Adds a catch-all level to a factor for any new values not encountered in model training, which lets R intelligently predict new levels in the test set.

```{r}

movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 

```


## `step_zv()`

Intelligently handles zero variance variables (variables that contain only a single value)

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) 
  
```


## `step_normalize()`

Centers then scales numeric variable (mean = 0, sd = 1)

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())  %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) 

```


## `step_corr()`

Removes highly correlated variables

```{r}

```


# Define different models to fit

```{r}
## Model Building

# 1. Pick a `model type`
# 2. set the `engine`
# 3. Set the `mode`: regression or classification

# Logistic regression
log_spec <-  logistic_reg() %>%  # model type
  set_engine(engine = "glm") %>%  # model engine
  set_mode("classification") # model mode

# Show your model specification
log_spec

# Decision Tree
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine(engine = "C5.0") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

tree_spec

# Random Forest
library(ranger)

rf_spec <- 
  rand_forest() %>% 
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")


# Boosted tree (XGBoost)
library(xgboost)

xgb_spec <- 
  boost_tree() %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") 

# K-nearest neighbour (k-NN)
knn_spec <- 
  nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 4) %>% # we can adjust the number of neighbors 
  set_engine("kknn") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") 
```


# Bundle recipe and model with `workflows`


```{r}
log_wflow <- # new workflow object
 workflow() %>% # use workflow function
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>%   # use the new recipe
 add_model(log_spec)   # add your model spec

# show object
log_wflow


## A few more workflows

tree_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(tree_spec) 

rf_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(rf_spec) 

xgb_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(xgb_spec)

knn_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(knn_spec)

```

1. How many models have you specified?
2. What's the difference between a model specification and a workflow?
3. Do you need to add a formula (e.g., `test ~ .`)  if you have a recipe?
